# ALG - Algorithms Design and Optimization Introduction

Semestral projects for ALG1 course.


ALG1
Includes a Ruby implementation of basic data structures such as a Queue, Stack, LinkedList and BooleanArray with Queue and Stack implementations beeing based both on LL and BA.


ALG2
Includes a Ruby implementation of a conceptual sorting algorithm (called in Czech Hrabičkové třídění ~ Rake Sorting) which is an algorithm similar to Shell Sort.
Includes a short essay discussing the theory and results of an experiment comparing implemented algorithm with two broadly used sorting algs - Quick and Insertion sorts.


ALG3
Includes a Ruby implementation of an experimental benchmark testing Insert, Find and Delete operations over three data structures - UnsortedArray, SortedArray and BinarySearchTree.
Includes a short essay discussing the theory and results of an experiment comparing the operation times (for one dataset, one operation and on logaritmical scale).


ALG4
Includes a Ruby implementation of a minimalistic "cloud" simulation with a distribution of tasks among a group of computers.
