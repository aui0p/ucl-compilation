# GAL - Graph Algorithms project

Semestral work for GAL course.

Includes a Ruby implementation of Kruskal, Dijkstra and DFS algorithms over concrete OpenMaps data with specified tasks such as picking the largest map component (ergo filtering of small, isolated islands), reducing wertex noise through a minimal spaning tree and finally shortest route finding. Finding itself can be performed over known vertices with known latitude and longtitude or with performing a closest vertex search beforehand. 
By default, Dijkstra takes one way roads into consideration.
